# Functional Event Sourcing

This repository has moved to Codeberg: https://codeberg.org/thinkbeforecoding/es-workshop

To run this exercise you'll need
* a code editor (VS code is recommendanded for F# tooling)
* .net core sdk 3.1 

# Using docker
If you have docker and VS code installed, install the 
`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers` extension.
Then use `Shift+Ctrl+P` to launch the
`Remote-Containers: Open folder in Container...` command
and select this folder.
It will start a `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.1` container
